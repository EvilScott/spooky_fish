  <h3>Our mission</h3>
  <p>
    Cradle to Grave Fishing Gear Tracker was developed to support responsible fishing through better understanding of
    the quantity of gear lost and abandoned in the world's oceans. The tracker encourages safe disposal of gear at
    the end of its life, reporting of lost and abandoned gear, and tracking of gear replacement and new gear. Through
    understanding the amount of new gear entering the fishing industry and comparing this quantity to the amount of
    known gear exiting through proper disposal, the goal is to come to a better understanding of the true amount of
    gear unaccounted for that could be lost and abandoned in the oceans.
